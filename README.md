üåê Project Description ‚Äì FixLab Website

I designed and developed a modern, responsive multi-page website for FixLab, focusing on smooth interactions, clean UI, and optimized performance.

üîë Key Features:

Custom Loader Animation

A lightweight loader appears on first load before revealing the main content.

Keeps the user engaged while resources are being fetched.

Responsive Navbar with Menu Animation

Desktop view shows standard navigation links.

On mobile, the navigation transforms into a menu button that toggles a full-screen overlay menu with smooth transitions.

Uses z-index handling to ensure the menu always appears above page content.

Interactive Hero & Content Sections

Hero section with text + video background for an engaging first impression.

Responsive Swiper Slider optimized to show multiple slides on desktop and a single slide on mobile.

Dynamic hover effects with sliding overlays built using position: absolute and transition animations.

Overlay Effects for Cards/Projects

Each card/item reveals a colored overlay on hover.

Content layers (z-index) ensure text remains visible and interactive.

Fully reusable with class-based targeting instead of IDs.

Footer Design

Fixed, responsive footer with social/contact info.

Scales properly across desktop and mobile layouts.

Performance & UX Improvements

CSS transitions for smooth animations.

Responsive media queries for breakpoints at 580px, 768px, and 992px.

Clean HTML structure with semantic elements.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)

Swiper.js for responsive slider

Custom animations with transition and transform

Responsive layout with Flexbox & media queries

üëâ This project showcases my skills in front-end web development, responsive design, and interactive UI animations. It delivers both a functional and visually appealing experience across devices.
